This built this project as part of the "The Complete MVC5 Course". In this project many techniques have been demonstrated such as Entity Framework CodeFirst, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Themes, typeahead, toast notifications, some jQuery.

I also extended this project as part of the "Become a Full-stack .NET Developer - Architecture and Testing" course by using the repository pattern, decouple project from dependencies using interfaces and much more.
